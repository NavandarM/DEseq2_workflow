MissingOutputException in rule deseq2_analysis in file "/home/navandar/Projects/Denboba_lab/GenVsControl/DEseq2_TEsmall/wf-Deseq.smk", line 21:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/navandar/Projects/Denboba_lab/GenVsControl/DEseq2_TEsmall/DEoutput/DEoutput/Pcaplot.pdf (missing locally, parent dir contents: VarianceStabilizedCounts.txt, Normalized_Read_Counts.txt, deseq_results.done)

Removing output files of failed job deseq2_analysis since they might be corrupted:

Shutting down, this might take some time.
